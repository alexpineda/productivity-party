# PartyKit Server Optimizations

This document describes the optimizations made to the PartyKit server to improve performance, reliability, and resource usage.

## 1. Batch Processing for Score Updates

We've implemented a batch processing system for score updates that:

- Collects score updates in a queue over a 5-second window
- Processes them in a single database transaction
- Reduces database calls by up to 90% during high traffic periods
- Handles banned user filtering in bulk

## 2. Connection Lifecycle Management

Added proper connection lifecycle handling:

- Tracks user disconnections
- Cleans up resources when users leave
- Sends system notifications when users join/leave
- Forces processing of any pending updates on disconnect

## 3. Rate Limiting

Implemented a sliding window rate limiter to:

- Prevent message spam and DoS attacks
- Limit users to 10 messages per minute
- Provide clear feedback when limits are hit
- Maintain state efficiency with automatic cleanup of old timestamps

## 4. Message Storage Optimization

Improved message storage efficiency:

- More efficient array operations for message storage
- Reduced duplicate broadcasts
- Optimized memory usage for message history

## 5. Server Shutdown Handling

Added proper server shutdown procedures:

- Graceful cleanup of resources on SIGTERM/SIGINT
- Processing of any pending updates before shutdown
- Notification to connected clients about server status
- Prevention of new messages during shutdown process

## 6. Scoreboard Caching

Implemented TTL caching for scoreboard queries:

- Reduces database load by caching scoreboard for 60 seconds
- Automatic cache invalidation on score updates
- Properly typed cache entries
- Efficient cache validation

## Future Optimization Ideas

Potential further optimizations:

- Implement websocket compression for reduced bandwidth
- Add persistent connection health checks
- Implement more advanced content filtering
- Add horizontal scaling support for multiple PartyKit instances
